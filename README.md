# Statistical-and-Prediction-analysis-of-Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Data(88.67%Acc.)
In this project the PIMA Indian diabetes dataset analysed is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of analysis is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.             The diabetes dataset is a binary classification problem where it needs to analyse whether a patient is suffering from the diabetes disease or not on the basis of many available features in the dataset . In this project, various machine learning algorithms are applied to predict diabetes, based on specific attributes and compared their performance measures to choose best classifier.
